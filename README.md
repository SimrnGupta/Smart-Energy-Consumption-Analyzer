# Sustainable Energy Analytics Platform
## Project Overview
The Sustainable Energy Analytics Platform is a comprehensive tool designed to analyze and forecast energy consumption, carbon emissions, and energy access globally. Utilizing a rich dataset spanning from 2000 to 2020, our platform leverages advanced machine learning models and large language models (LLMs) to provide actionable insights and predictive analytics. This tool aims to aid policymakers and stakeholders in crafting informed, sustainable energy policies and climate action initiatives.

## Key Features
- **Predictive Modeling**: Using **GEMINI 1.0 Pro**, our platform offers precise forecasts on energy consumption and carbon emissions through advanced machine learning algorithms.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Developed with **Flask, React, Next.js, and TypeScript**, the dashboard provides dynamic data visualization, allowing users to interactively explore energy trends and projections.
- **LLM Integration**: A fine-tuned version of Google’s GEMINI 1.0 Pro enhances our model's relevance and accuracy, making the platform a robust tool for real-time data processing and predictive analytics.
